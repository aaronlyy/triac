## Goals & Roadmap
I mainly created this project to learn more about **NETWORKING**, **SOCKETS** and **HTTP** with C.
But I also want to create something that can actually be used and is helpful to me or other.
I'll try to add as many comments explaining why I have done what in the code as possible so the code can be used as a learning ressource too.

Here is a list of things i want to implement or already have implemented:
- Some helpful network utility functions 
- Basic socket server
- Basic socket client
- Non blocking socket server + multiple connections
- HTTP/1.1 support
- Serving files from server
- Templating for html files
- Hot reloading on file changes
- Implement REST API using triac itself
- Controlling normal socket connections using REST
- Full web interface to control socket clients

These may change anytime.
