## Goals & Roadmap
I created this project to learn more about **SOCKETS**, **HTTP** and **NETWORKING** with C in general.

Maybe I'll add some functionality to control connected sockets through HTTP using REST and a web interface. I also kinda want to add templating functionality for html files.

Here is a list of things i want to implement or already have implemented:
- Basic socket server
- Basic socket client
- Non blocking socket server + multiple connections
- HTTP/1.1 support
- Serving files from server
- Templating for html files
- Hot reloading on file changes
- Implement REST API using triac itself
- Controlling normal socket connections using REST
- Full web interface to control socket clients

These may change anytime.
